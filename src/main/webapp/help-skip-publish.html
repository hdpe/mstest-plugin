		With this option selected, the MSTest output will be transformed to
		JUnit-style XML, but the report will not be published by Jenkins. The
		"Publish JUnit test result report" post-build action will need to be
		added subsequently in order for the report to be visible in the UI. The
		test report XML generated by this plugin is written to
		<code>temporary-junit-reports</code> in the root of the workspace.
	</p>
	<p>
		This option is useful if you are using plugins that rely on the
		JUnit plugin extension points.
